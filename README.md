# SwiftUI-ScrollView

I have practiced 2 more amazing features introduced by Apple for ScrollView. There would be opportunities to use them to list credit cards or shopping campaigns. The video shows us what I've built clearly.

[**scrollTransition(_:axis:transition:)**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/scrolltransition(_:axis:transition:))
>Applies the given transition, animating between the phases of the transition as this view appears and disappears within the visible region of the containing scroll view, or other container specified using the coordinateSpace parameter.

</br>

[**scrollTargetBehavior**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scrolltargetbehavior)
>A type that defines the scroll behavior of a scrollable view.
